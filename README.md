# PMDR
Php MarkDown Reader
***

This is a **PHP SCRIPT** to read markdown files. Useful for making pages for websites that havent released yet or messages for maintenance, or your own personal bio page. Whatever you want!

I don't care if you want to credit me or not, I have even added the option to turn the credits off. But if you want to, please keep it there.

Made with PHP 8.2
